  <b>Project Title: </b>Infographic Signage<br>
  <b>Principal Investigator: </b>Eric Ragan, PhD <br>
  <b>Introduction</b><br>
  You are invited to take part in a research study at Texas A&M University. The information in this form is given to help you decide whether or not to take part. If you decide you do not want to participate, there will be no penalty to you, and you will not lose any benefits.
  <br>
  <b>Why Is This Study Being Done?</b><br>
  The purpose of this study is to study how people view and understand visual signs and information visualization. This is important to know how people judge charts, graphs, and data.
  <br>
  <b>Why Am I Being Asked To Be In This Study?</b><br>
  Participants are needed to help us learn how people look at visual charts. You are being asked to be in this study because you volunteered.
  <br>
  <b>How Many People Will Be Asked To Be In This Study?</b><br>
  Up to 1000 people may be contacted about participating.
  <br>
  <b>What Are the Alternatives to being in this study?</b><br>
  You do not have to participate.
  <br>
  <b>What Will I Be Asked To Do In This Study?</b><br>
  The study has two sessions. The first session may take up to 25 minutes. You will be asked to complete a background questionnaire. We will then show you different forms of visuals that include charts, graphs, and infographics. We will ask you for your thoughts and interpretation of the visuals. You will be asked to return one week later for the second session, which will take up to 15 minutes. In the second session, we will ask additional questions about the visuals.
  <br>
  <b>Are There Any Risks To Me?</b><br>
  The risks associated with this study are minimal, and are not greater than risks ordinarily encountered with daily computer use. You do not have to answer anything you do not want to, and you can stop at any time without penalty. We are using audio and video recording to study how you use the software; this data will not be shared outside of the research team, and it will be destroyed when the research project is concluded. The recorded results of your use with the software during the analysis activity will be saved and made publicly available online, but this data will not include any of your personal information. No photos, audio recordings, or video recordings of you will be shared.
  <br>
  <b>Will There Be Any Costs To Me?</b><br>
  Aside from your time, there are no costs for taking part in the study.
  <br>
  <b>Will I Be Paid To Be In This Study?</b><br>
  No. No payment will be given.
  <br>
  <b>Who will know about my participation in this research study?</b><br>
  Information about you will be kept confidential and not shared with others. Only the approved members of the research team will have access to the information collected during your participation. In addition, representatives of regulatory agencies such as the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) and entities such as the Texas A&M University Human Subjects Protection Program may access your records to make sure the study is being run correctly and that information is collected and secured properly.<br>
  <b>Whom do I contact with questions about the research?</b><br>
  If you have questions regarding this study, you may contact Eric Ragan (eragan@tamu.edu).
  <br>
  <b>Whom do I contact about my rights as a research participant?</b><br>
  For questions about your rights as a research participant; or if you have questions, complaints, or concerns about the research, you may contact the Texas A&M University Human Subjects Protection Program at 979.458.4067, toll-free at 1.855.795.8636, or email at irb@tamu.edu
